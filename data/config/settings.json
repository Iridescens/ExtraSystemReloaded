	#these can be used to apply a flat buff to all upgrade values just by raising the scalar values.
	#scalar defines the multiplier applied to the final value of the algorithm.
	#percentOfLevels is the percentage of levels that the scalar applies for. setting it to 1 will make all upgrades
	# that have not already been applied apply at that level. setting it to -1 does the same, except that if you somehow
	# break the max level limit it will completely ignore that. i recommend always having a -1 in there.
