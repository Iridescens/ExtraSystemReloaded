  #upgrade settings

  #note that adding additional values will not work unless you modify the source code and rebuild the jar.
  #setting certain values too high may have unintended consequences. i have attempted to cap the problem values
  #but it is not perfect.

  #setting certain values to negative may have unintended consequences. especially the quality mult.
  #if you want negative scaling, focus on the Scalar values.

  #if a variable ends with UpgradeScalar, that is the multiplier for upgrade levels.
  #if a variable ends with QualityMult, that is the exponent modifier for quality.
  #both of the above for the same stat signify that a variable is subject to diminishing returns.

  #if a variable ends with Scalar, it is a flat multiplier multiplied with level.
