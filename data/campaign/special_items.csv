Hyperferrous Chain,esr_ammospool,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/ammo_feeder_chain.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.SpooledFeedersItem,,"Although unable to be used for the same purpose as a full-size Fullerene spool, this much-smaller chain can be used instead to replace many of the moving mechanical parts within a ship. The chain notably increases the rate of fire of weapons upon being disturbed, generating some kind of intense field that crew members can only describe as \"bloodthirsty\". The chain slows down considerably after a couple seconds, with an effect on the ship that matches its slower speed.",301
Plasma Flux Catalyst,esr_plasmacatalyst,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/plasma_flux_catalyst.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.PlasmaCatalystItem,,"A Plasma Flux Catalyst can be used to vastly decrease the amount of equipment needed to provide power to a ship thanks to its ability to extract that energy from any number of capacitors in parallel. The space saved allows for more complicated weaponry to be installed, although the resulting heat from such a system is dreadful if too many capacitors or flux vents are installed.",302
Drive Flux Vent,esr_drivevent,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/fusion_missile_ignitor.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.DriveVentItem,,"An experimental flux vent that can only function under the intense heat that ship thrusters generate. It excels at venting flux, so well in fact that the thrusters around it receive a temporary increase in power that only shows in the forward direction. This effect resides for a couple seconds after venting as well. Crew members remark that the purple glow of the engines is one of the prettiest sights to ever see, but the reduced ability to retreat never lets them be at ease.",303
Hangar Microforge,esr_hangarforge,"",Ko Combine,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/hangar_forge.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.HangarForgeItem,,"Although not exactly employing the processes used by nanoforges, this forge is essentially one writ small. Corruption isn't known to affect these forges, and even if it did, hulls produced by this nano-nanoforge are small enough that defects don't leave a noticable difference in the first place. Some engineers have even claimed to be able to hack these devices to produce missiles instead, owing as a testament to their stability.",304
Equalizer Core,esr_equalizercore,"",Domain Restricted,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/equalizer_core.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.EqualizerCoreItem,,"This core is dedicated to managing weaponry to an degree that rivals even Alpha Cores given control of weapon arrays, with one unique quirk: effective ordnance ranges of non-missile weapons are equalized to a certain degree. The core, in its Terms of Use, swears by its Stronger than an Alpha trademark, and it can't be used for anything but weapons.. supposedly.",305
Phasefield Engine,esr_phaseengine,"",Tri-Tachyon,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/phasefield_engine.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,extrasystemreloaded.augments.items.PhasefieldEngineItem,,"A Tri-Tachyon joint venture with Ko Combine to reduce catastrophic asteroid impacts, a phasefield engine can be used to generate a protective field around a ship. The phase field completely dissipates when the hull is destroyed, but the phase field can transport an incoming projectile with enough energy into p-space. This protective ability is worth the briefly horrified faces that crew members occasionally develop, like they've seen and subsequently forgotten what is behind the giant signature that a phase sensor reads from it.",305
