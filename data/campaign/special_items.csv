Hyperferrous Chain,esr_ammospool,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/ammo_feeder_chain.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,com.fs.starfarer.api.campaign.impl.items.GenericSpecialItemPlugin,,"Although unable to be used for the same purpose as a full-size Fullerene spool, this much-smaller chain can be used instead to feed ammo directly to ballistic weapons with an also-much-smaller footprint than typical ammo feeders. The only reason that experts can explain as to why this method of ammunition feeding isn't on ships today is due to the very high-tech focus during the Exploration era of the Domain, which the chain causes significant issues with.",301
Plasma Flux Catalyst,esr_plasmacatalyst,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/plasma_flux_catalyst.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,com.fs.starfarer.api.campaign.impl.items.GenericSpecialItemPlugin,,"A plasma flux catalyst has but a singular use to a starship, and that is greatly simplifying the equipment needed to charge energy weapons. The resulting heat from such a system can cause issues with any moving parts, like ballistic ammunition feeders, unless they are supported by advanced heatsinks.",302
Fusion Missile Ignitor,esr_fusionmissileignitor,"",Fabrique Orbitale,,20000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/fusion_missile_ignitor.png,ui_cargo_special_biotech_pickup,ui_cargo_special_tech_drop,com.fs.starfarer.api.campaign.impl.items.GenericSpecialItemPlugin,,"This is an ignitor from an orbital fusion lamp. With some retooling of the launch tubes on a ship, they can be used to provide thrust to missiles much more efficiently than any other system, leaving room for more complicated missile systems to be installed.",303

Corruption isn't known to affect these forges, and even if it did, hulls produced by this nano-nanoforge are small enough that defects don't leave a noticable difference in the first place.",304

The core, in its Terms of Use, swears by its Stronger than an Alpha trademark, and it can't be used for anything but weapons.. supposedly.",305

The phase field completely dissipates when the hull is destroyed, but the phase field can transport an incoming projectile with enough energy into p-space. This protective ability is worth the briefly horrified faces that crew members occasionally develop, like they've seen and subsequently forgotten what is behind the giant signature that a phase sensor reads from it.",305
